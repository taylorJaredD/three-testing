#three.js Testing#

###Why did you choose this subject?###
  I thought it would be interesting to see what it was like to programmatically create 3D objects.

###What problem does it solve?###
  Good question

###Why does one use it?###
  It seems like it can be used to create 3D games or augmented and virtual reality environments.

###What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?###
  The documentation was hard to follow and felt like it didn't explain how to do anything.
  It took a while to even figure out how to install it and if it could be used in atom.

###What resources do you recommend for interested students?###
  The examples of what people have been able to make with it are interesting and surprising
  considering how difficult the documentation was to follow.  If you really want to make something
  in 3D, just use an actually 3D package and not try to code it.
